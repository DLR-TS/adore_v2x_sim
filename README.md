### v2xsim is a ROS simulation package for ITSG5 radio messages 
For each simulated ITSG5 message X, a "SimX.msg" file is provided in msg folder.
A SimX message transports the original ROS version of the ITSG5 message and a meta information header of type "V2XMetaSIM",
which contains send power, send location, send time and the size of the message on the physical channgel as bytecount.
A node "channel_sim_node" is provided by this package: The node relays messages between the simulation channel "/SIM/v2x/X", (where "X" stands for message type) and the reception and send channels of a station, "v2x/incoming/X" and "v2x/outgoing/X".
```
/SIM/v2x/X: SimX.msg  -->  v2x/incoming/X: X.msg
/SIM/v2x/X: SimX.msg  <--  v2x/outgoing/X: X.msg
```
The channel_sim_node further receives its station's position information of type "nav_msgs/Odometry.msg" on topic "odom" in order to compare a messages send location and the station's location on reception of a message.

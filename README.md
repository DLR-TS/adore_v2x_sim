# A basic simulation package for ITS-G5 V2X radio messages
ADORe is an open source toolkit for automated vehicle control and decision making, with the main repository [eclipse/adore](https://github.com/eclipse/adore).
ADORe can be coupled with ROS. 
This module contains a basic model for simulation of v2x radio traffic exchanged between automated vehicles.
Messages from [v2x_if_ros_msg](https://github.com/dlr-ts/v2x_if_ros_msg) "V2X ROS messages" are exchanged between virtual stations.

## Structure
On this level the repository is a docker and make wrapper for the actual content in the module subfolder.

## Setup
This repository may be used on a system, which fulfills a set of requirements [adore_setup](https://github.com/dlr-ts/adore_setup).
After checkout, enter make in the top level of the repository in order to build.
